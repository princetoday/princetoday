Hi, I’m Prince Raj 👋  
2nd Year CSE (AIML) student who enjoys building things that people actually use.

I started coding out of curiosity, and somewhere along the way it became a 
habit of turning ideas into working software. I enjoy shipping projects, 
refining them, and learning from real-world feedback.

 Interests & skills:
- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- Machine Learning & data-driven projects
- Currently exploring Generative AI

I believe the best software feels invisible — no friction, just value.
